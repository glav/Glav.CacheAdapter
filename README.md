# Glav.CacheAdapter - README #

This library allows developers to code against a single interface ICacheProvider and be able to run against a variety of cache implementations simply by changing configuration values. The currently supported list of cache engine/implementations are:
* .Net memory cache
* ASP.Net Web cache
* [Windows Azure Appfabric](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cie/archive/2014/03/05/caching-on-windows-azure-microsoft-appfabric-cache-azure-cache-service-managed-cache-dedicated-cache-in-role-cache-co-located-cache-shared-cache-azure-role-based-cache-clarifying-the-naming-confusion.aspx) (also knows as shared cache). Note: Microsoft will be retiring this technology.
* [memcached](http://memcached.org/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)

Note that this is only a brief introduction to the CacheAdatper, however for more detailed information, see the related blog posts listed below.
